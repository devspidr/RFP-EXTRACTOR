# üìë AI-Powered RFP Extractor ‚Äî Hybrid NLP + RAG + LLM (Gemini + LangChain)

An intelligent Streamlit application that automatically extracts **structured data** from **Request for Proposal (RFP)** documents in **PDF** or **HTML** format.  
It uses **Google Gemini (via LangChain)** for text understanding and combines **NLP-based extraction** with a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline for large documents.

---

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Upload RFPs in **PDF** or **HTML** format  
‚úÖ Supports both **small** and **large** documents  
‚úÖ Dual Extraction Mode: **NLP + LLM** (for small docs) and **RAG + LLM** (for large docs)  
‚úÖ Extracts 20+ key RFP fields (Bid No., Due Date, Vendor Info, Terms, etc.)  
‚úÖ Automatic saving of extracted JSON to `outputs/` folder  
‚úÖ Interactive and beautiful **Streamlit UI** with gradient theme  
‚úÖ Supports **Gemini Flash**, **Pro**, and **1.5 / 2.0** variants  
‚úÖ Fallbacks for missing dependencies (FAISS, Sentence Transformers)  

---

## üß† How It Works

The application uses **two distinct modes** of extraction based on **document size**:



### 1Ô∏è‚É£ NLP + LLM Mode (for small documents)
- Used when PDF has **‚â§100 pages** or HTML has **‚â§50,000 characters**.
- The **entire text** of the document is sent directly to **Gemini LLM**.
- The LLM extracts predefined fields using structured prompts.
- Quick and efficient for short RFPs.

> **Pipeline:**
> PDF/HTML ‚Üí Text Extraction ‚Üí Gemini Prompt ‚Üí JSON Output

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ RAG + LLM Mode (for large documents)
- Used when PDF has **>100 pages** or HTML has **>50,000 characters**.
- The document is split into **smaller overlapping chunks**.
- Each chunk is embedded using **Sentence Transformers** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- Embeddings are stored in a **FAISS vector index** for fast retrieval.
- For each field (e.g., "Due Date"), the top relevant chunks are retrieved and passed to **Gemini** for field extraction.

> **Pipeline:**
> PDF/HTML ‚Üí Chunking ‚Üí Embedding ‚Üí FAISS Search ‚Üí Gemini Prompt per Field ‚Üí JSON Output

If FAISS or Sentence Transformers aren‚Äôt installed, a **keyword-based fallback retriever** is automatically used.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note About ZIP Input and Outputs

While checking with ZIP file outputs, you may notice that one of the extracted JSON outputs contains mostly `null` values.  
I‚Äôm not sure why this happened, as the original output (when running the app on individual files) works correctly extracting correct json outputs.  
Please consider this as a potential edge case.  
If you‚Äôd like to verify the app‚Äôs functionality, feel free to **clone this repository and run it locally** ‚Äî the extraction process works as expected on standard inputs.

üí° Notes & Best Practices

    Keep RFP documents cleanly formatted for best accuracy.

    Gemini Flash models are faster, while Pro models provide higher accuracy.

    Large RFPs are automatically handled via RAG pipeline.

    The app does not store your uploaded files or API keys permanently.
